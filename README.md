# IAT Injector

** Import Address Table Injection from inside of a kernel driver, manual mapper, and execution take place from the driver with no client. ** <\br>
It's a cool concept attempting manual mapping from kernel, but realistically it's dumb and unconventional to do your entire injection, mapping and execution from kernel. <\br>
I hope someone can use some of the fundamental concepts for manual mapping or e.g.. from this repository. Executing your depedency by direct swapping entries from IAT are detected non the less
